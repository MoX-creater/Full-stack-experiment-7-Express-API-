## Connecting React Frontend to Express API Using Axios
# Overview

This project demonstrates how to connect a React frontend application to a backend Express.js API using Axios. It shows how to perform HTTP requests in React, manage loading and error states, and display dynamic data fetched from a backend service. The goal is to help you understand how the frontend and backend interact in a full stack JavaScript application.

# Objective

Build a simple Express.js API that serves product data.

Create a React frontend that fetches and displays product data using Axios.

Handle loading and error states in the React component.

Run both frontend and backend locally to verify successful integration.

# Running the Application

Start the Express backend:

cd backend
node server.js


Server runs at: http://localhost:5000

Start the React frontend:

cd frontend
npm start


React app runs at: http://localhost:3000

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The app should display a list of products fetched from the backend API.

# Testing

If the backend is not running, the React app should display an error message.
When both servers are active, the products should appear with their names and prices.
Use browser dev tools or console logs to inspect API calls and responses.
